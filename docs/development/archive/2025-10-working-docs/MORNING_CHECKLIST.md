> automated SOX validation tests, and complete audit trail. 
> It exceeds SOX requirements and provides legal-grade evidence."

### For Sandeep (email subject)
> "SQL Server → Athena Table Mappings for C-PG-1 Automation"

### For Sandeep (email opening)
> "I'm finalizing C-PG-1 automation and need your help with Athena table 
> mappings. This is the last blocker for automation that will save 40+ 
> hours/month. I've documented everything in detail."
