# Quick Start Guide - Morning Meetings

**Date**: 21 October 2025  
**Your Two Priorities**: Evidence Review + Table Mapping Request

---

## üéØ Meeting 1: Joao & Archana (Evidence Package Review)

### What to Show

**Open this file first**: [`EVIDENCE_PACKAGE_PRESENTATION.md`](./EVIDENCE_PACKAGE_PRESENTATION.md)

**Key slides to cover**:
1. **Page 1-2**: Executive Summary
   - 7 files vs 1 screenshot
   - Tamper-proof cryptographic integrity
   
2. **Page 3-15**: File-by-File walkthrough
   - Show current IPE_09 example
   - Explain what each file provides
   
3. **Page 16**: SHA-256 Hash (CRITICAL INNOVATION)
   - Legal-grade tamper detection
   - Better than screenshots
   
4. **Page 17**: Comparison Table
   - Manual vs SOXauto
   - Show 10x improvement

**Live Demo**: Navigate to `/evidence/IPE_09/20251020_174311_789/`
- Show `execution_metadata.json`
- Show `01_executed_query.sql`
- Explain what's missing (5 more files)

### Questions to Ask

1. **Sufficiency**: Are 7 evidence files enough for SOX? Need more?
2. **Storage**: Where to store long-term? (Recommend S3)
3. **Retention**: How long? (Standard is 7 years)
4. **Training**: Do auditors need training on evidence verification?
5. **Enhancements**: Any additional evidence components needed?

### Expected Duration

30-35 minutes total

### Backup Documents

If they want technical details:
- [`EVIDENCE_GAP_ANALYSIS.md`](./EVIDENCE_GAP_ANALYSIS.md) - Current vs Target
- `/src/core/evidence/manager.py` - Code implementation

## üìß Task 2: Send Email to Sandeep (Table Mapping)

### Email Template

**Subject**: SQL Server ‚Üí Athena Table Mappings for C-PG-1 Automation

**Body**:

```
Hi Sandeep,

I'm finalizing the C-PG-1 automation and need your help with Athena table mappings. 
This is the last blocker for automation that will save 40+ hours/month.

I've prepared a comprehensive document with all details:
‚Üí docs/development/TABLE_MAPPING_FOR_SANDEEP.md

**Quick Summary**: Need Athena equivalents for 14 SQL Server tables

**Top 3 Priority Questions**:

1. CR_04 (CRITICAL): What is the Athena equivalent of 
   V_BS_ANAPLAN_IMPORT_IFRS_MAPPING_CURRENCY_SPLIT?
   ‚Üí This is the GL balance table - entire reconciliation depends on it

2. RPT_SOI (HIGH): What column do I filter on to distinguish:
   - Prepayments (IPE_10)
   - Unreconciled Packages (IPE_12)  
   - Refunds (IPE_34)

3. IPE_31 (MEDIUM): How do the 7 Collection Account tables join together?
   - RPT_CASHREC_TRANSACTION (main table?)
   - RPT_PACKLIST_PAYMENTS (join via what key?)
   - Others...

**Impact**: 
- Currently: 1/10 IPEs working (10%)
- Blocked: 9/10 IPEs waiting on mappings (90%)
- Timeline: Full automation by mid-November once mappings received

**How to Respond**:
- Fill in the summary table in the doc, OR
- Send me 2-3 sample Athena queries as examples, OR
- Let's schedule a 15-min screen share

**Attached Document**: docs/development/TABLE_MAPPING_FOR_SANDEEP.md

Thanks for your help unblocking this!

Best,
Gustave
```

## üìä Current Status Reference

### Evidence Generation

**What Works Now**:
- ‚úÖ Evidence directory creation
- ‚úÖ Query documentation (SQL file)
- ‚úÖ Execution metadata (JSON)

**What's Missing** (code ready, needs integration):
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Query parameters documentation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Data snapshot (100 rows sample)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Statistical summary
- ‚ö†Ô∏è SHA-256 integrity hash ‚≠ê CRITICAL
- ‚ö†Ô∏è SOX validation results
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Execution log

**Effort to Complete**: 4-6 hours coding

### IPE Automation

| IPE | Description | Status | Blocker |
|-----|-------------|--------|---------|
| IPE_07 | Customer AR | ‚ùå Blocked | Need table mapping |
| IPE_08 | Voucher Liabilities | ‚ùå Blocked | Need table mapping |
| IPE_09 | BOB Sales Orders | ‚úÖ **WORKING** | None |
| IPE_10 | Customer Prepayments | ‚ùå Blocked | Need table mapping |
| IPE_11 | Marketplace Accrued Rev | ‚ùå Blocked | Need table mapping |
| IPE_12 | Unreconciled Packages | ‚ùå Blocked | Need table mapping |
| IPE_31 | Collection Accounts | ‚ùå Blocked | Need table mapping |
| IPE_34 | Refund Liability | ‚ùå Blocked | Need table mapping |
| CR_04 | NAV GL Balances | ‚ùå Blocked | Need table mapping |
| CR_05 | FX Rates | ‚ùå Blocked | Need table mapping |

**Progress**: 1/10 working (10%)

## üí° Key Talking Points

### For Joao & Archana

**Opening** (30 seconds):
> "I want to show you how SOXauto generates evidence. Instead of manual screenshots, 
> we create 7 comprehensive evidence files with cryptographic integrity proof. 
> This exceeds SOX requirements and provides legal-grade evidence."

**Demo** (2 minutes):
> "Let me show you a working example. Here's IPE_09 - we have the query that was 
> executed and metadata. We're building toward 7 total files including a SHA-256 
> hash that proves the data hasn't been tampered with."

**Close** (30 seconds):
> "Are 7 files sufficient? Where should we store these long-term? Do auditors 
> need training on verification?"

### For Sandeep (Email)

**Opening**:
> "Need your help with the final blocker for C-PG-1 automation"

**Value Prop**:
> "This will save 40+ hours/month and eliminate manual errors"

**Call to Action**:
> "Can you help me map these 14 SQL Server tables to Athena? I've documented 
> everything in detail."

**Make it Easy**:
> "Fill in the table, OR send sample queries, OR 15-min screen share - 
> whatever's easiest for you"

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Evidence Package Reality Check

**Be Honest with Joao & Archana**:
- We generate 2/7 files today
- Code exists for all 7 files (proven, tested)
- Need 4-6 hours to integrate missing files
- Can demo complete package within 1 week

### Table Mapping Dependency

**Be Clear on Timeline**:
- 1 IPE working now (IPE_09)
- 9 IPEs blocked on Sandeep's mappings
- Cannot proceed without table mappings
- Once received, can complete in 2 weeks

### Success Metrics

**What Good Looks Like**:
- Joao/Archana: "Yes, 7 files are sufficient. Store in S3. 7-year retention."
- Sandeep: Provides complete table mappings within 1 week
- Result: Full automation by mid-November
