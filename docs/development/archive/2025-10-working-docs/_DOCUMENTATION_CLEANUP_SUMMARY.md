# Documentation Cleanup Summary

**Date**: 21 October 2025  
**Action**: Unified and organized redundant documentation files  
**Result**: Created single consolidated request for Sandeep

---

## 📋 What Was Done

### Created New Master Document
**File**: `ATHENA_ACCESS_REQUEST_FOR_SANDEEP.md`

**Purpose**: Single, comprehensive, well-organized request containing:
- All 15 table mappings needed
- Priority ranking (Critical → High → Medium → Low)
- GL account references for each IPE
- Specific questions for complex scenarios (multi-table joins, multi-purpose tables)
- Business impact and ROI justification
- Working example (IPE_09) as reference
- Multiple response options for Sandeep

## 🔄 Redundant Files Status

### Files with Overlapping Content

| File | Status | Action Recommended |
|------|--------|-------------------|
| `TABLE_MAPPING_FOR_SANDEEP.md` | ⚠️ Redundant | Archive or delete - content merged into new file |
| `OFFICIAL_TABLE_MAPPING.md` | ⚠️ Redundant | Archive or delete - content merged into new file |
| `ATHENA_QUESTIONS_FOR_TEAM.md` | 📝 Keep | Different audience (internal team vs Sandeep) |
| `QUICK_REFERENCE_FOR_TEAM.md` | 📝 Keep | Quick reference card for daily use |
| `evidence_documentation.md` | 📝 Keep | Different topic (evidence package structure) |
| `EVIDENCE_GAP_ANALYSIS.md` | 📝 Keep | Technical analysis of what's missing |

## 📁 Recommended Actions

### Files to Archive
Move to `/docs/development/archive/` or delete:

1. **TABLE_MAPPING_FOR_SANDEEP.md**
   - Reason: Content fully merged into new comprehensive document
   - Contains: Similar table mappings, less organized
   - Decision: Archive (keep for history) or delete

2. **OFFICIAL_TABLE_MAPPING.md**
   - Reason: Content fully merged into new comprehensive document
   - Contains: Initial mapping request, less complete
   - Decision: Archive (keep for history) or delete

### Files to Keep
These serve different purposes:

1. **ATHENA_QUESTIONS_FOR_TEAM.md** ✅
   - Audience: Internal team
   - Purpose: Team discussion questions
   - Keep separate from Sandeep request

2. **QUICK_REFERENCE_FOR_TEAM.md** ✅
   - Audience: Daily users
   - Purpose: Quick lookup during development
   - Keep for operational use

3. **evidence_documentation.md** ✅
   - Topic: Evidence package structure
   - Purpose: Explains 7-file evidence system
   - Different from table mapping request

4. **EVIDENCE_GAP_ANALYSIS.md** ✅
   - Topic: Technical implementation gaps
   - Purpose: Track what's working vs what's missing
   - Different from table mapping request

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (Today)
1. ✅ Review new `ATHENA_ACCESS_REQUEST_FOR_SANDEEP.md`
2. ⏳ Decide whether to archive or delete redundant files
3. ⏳ Send new document to Sandeep

### Short-term (This Week)
1. ⏳ Wait for Sandeep's response
2. ⏳ Update `pg1_catalog.py` with Athena configurations once received
3. ⏳ Test first 2-3 table mappings

### Medium-term (Next 2 Weeks)
1. ⏳ Implement all IPE queries with confirmed table mappings
2. ⏳ Generate complete 7-file evidence packages
3. ⏳ End-to-end reconciliation testing
