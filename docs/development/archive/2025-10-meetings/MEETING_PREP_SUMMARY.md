## 📋 Quick Reference

### Evidence Package Structure (Priority 1)

Current evidence for IPE_09 demonstrates the 7-file structure:

```
evidence/IPE_09/20251020_174311_789/
├── execution_metadata.json       # ✅ Generated
├── 01_executed_query.sql         # ✅ Generated
├── 02_query_parameters.json      # ⚠️  Not yet generated (needs implementation)
├── 03_data_snapshot.csv          # ⚠️  Not yet generated (needs implementation)
├── 04_data_summary.json          # ⚠️  Not yet generated (needs implementation)
├── 05_integrity_hash.json        # ⚠️  Not yet generated (needs implementation)
├── 06_validation_results.json    # ⚠️  Not yet generated (needs implementation)
└── 07_execution_log.json         # ⚠️  Not yet generated (needs implementation)
```

**Key Points for Joao & Archana**:
1. Current implementation generates 2/7 files (query + metadata)
2. Framework ready for all 7 files (code exists in `evidence/manager.py`)
3. SHA-256 cryptographic hash provides tamper-proof integrity
4. Evidence exceeds traditional screenshot approach
5. Fully programmatic and reproducible

**Questions to Ask**:
1. Are 7 evidence files sufficient for SOX compliance?
2. Should we add any additional evidence components?
3. Where should evidence be stored long-term? (S3 recommended)
4. Do auditors need training on evidence verification?
5. How long should evidence be retained? (7 years standard for SOX)

### Table Mapping Status (Priority 2)

**14 Tables Needed** | **1 Working** | **13 Blocked**

| Category | Tables | Status | Blocker |
|----------|--------|--------|---------|
| GL Balances (CR_04) | 1 | ❌ Blocked | Need Athena table name |
| Customer Ledgers (IPE_07) | 2 | ❌ Blocked | Need table names + column mapping |
| OMS Transactions (IPE_10/12/34) | 1 | ❌ Blocked | Need filter column to distinguish use cases |
| BOB Vouchers (IPE_08) | 1 | ❌ Blocked | Need Athena table name |
| BOB Sales (IPE_09) | 1 | ✅ **WORKING** | - |
| Seller Center (IPE_11) | 3 | ❌ Blocked | Need table names + join keys |
| Collection Accounts (IPE_31) | 7 | ❌ Blocked | Need join structure for 7-table query |
| FX Rates (CR_05) | 1 | ❌ Blocked | Need Athena table name |

**Most Critical Questions**:
1. **CR_04**: What is Athena equivalent of `V_BS_ANAPLAN_IMPORT_IFRS_MAPPING_CURRENCY_SPLIT`?
   - This is the GL balance - entire reconciliation depends on it
   
2. **RPT_SOI**: What column distinguishes Prepayments vs Packages vs Refunds?
   - One table used 3 different ways
   
3. **IPE_31**: How do 7 Collection Account tables join?
   - Most complex multi-table query

    order_date,
    order_id,
    customer_id,
    total_amount,
    order_status
FROM pg_bob_sales_order
WHERE order_date < DATE('2025-09-30')
ORDER BY order_date DESC
```

## 📧 Email to Sandeep

### Subject: SQL Server → Athena Table Mappings for C-PG-1 Automation

Hi Sandeep,

I'm working on automating the C-PG-1 control and need your help with Athena table mappings. This is the final blocker for automation that will save 40+ hours/month.

**What I Need**:
1. Athena database and table names for 14 SQL Server tables
2. Column name mappings (if different from SQL Server)
3. Join keys for multi-table queries (especially IPE_31)
4. Filter columns for tables used multiple ways (RPT_SOI)

**I've prepared a detailed document** with all questions: [`TABLE_MAPPING_FOR_SANDEEP.md`](./TABLE_MAPPING_FOR_SANDEEP.md)

**If you can only answer 3 questions**:
1. CR_04: What is Athena equivalent of `V_BS_ANAPLAN_IMPORT_IFRS_MAPPING_CURRENCY_SPLIT`?
2. RPT_SOI: What column distinguishes Prepayments vs Packages vs Refunds?
3. IPE_31: How do the 7 Collection Account tables join?

**How to Respond**:
- Fill in the summary table in the doc, OR
- Send 2-3 sample Athena queries, OR
- Let's schedule a 15-min screen share

**Timeline**: Once I have mappings, full automation by mid-November.

Thanks!
Gustave
