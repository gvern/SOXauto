# 🎉 BREAKTHROUGH #2: Official Common Report Reference Found

**Date**: 17 October 2025  
**Status**: ✅✅ OFFICIAL SOURCE DOCUMENTATION DISCOVERED  
**Impact**: Now have authoritative mapping from Confluence

---

## 🎯 What Changed

### Before (1 hour ago)
- Had Excel metadata showing output files and GL accounts
- Could infer which tables were used
- But wasn't 100% certain about the official sources

### After (NOW)
- Have the **official Common Report Reference table** from Confluence
- This is the authoritative documentation used by the entire SOX team
- Explicitly maps every IPE/CR report to its exact SQL Server source
- Can now ask perfectly targeted questions to technical team

## 🎁 Bonus Discovery: Complete SOX Coverage

The Common Report Reference table covers **ALL** SOX controls, not just C-PG-1:

- **IPE_01** → IPE_70: All IPE reports mapped
- **CR_01** → CR_08: All control reports mapped
- Multiple source systems: NAV, NAV BI, FinRec, BOB, OMS, Seller Center, JumiaPay, RING, etc.

**Implication**: Once we solve the table mapping for C-PG-1, we have a template for automating **every other SOX control**.

## 🎯 Your Action Plan (Refined)

### Step 1: Send Documentation to Technical Team

**Primary document**: `OFFICIAL_TABLE_MAPPING.md`  
**Supporting documents**: 
- `ATHENA_QUESTIONS_FOR_TEAM.md` (for detailed questions)
- `DATA_SOURCE_MAPPING.md` (for visual context)

**Email subject**:
> "C-PG-1 Automation: Athena Table Mapping Request (Based on Official Common Report Reference)"

**Email body** (suggested):

```
Hi Carlos/Joao,

Great news! I've located the official Common Report Reference table from 
Confluence that documents all IPE/CR report sources.

Based on this official documentation, I now have the exact list of SQL Server 
tables used by C-PG-1. I just need your help mapping them to their Athena 
equivalents.

Key findings:
- C-PG-1 uses 10 unique tables across 3 SQL Server databases
- Most are in AIG_Nav_Jumia_Reconciliation (FinRec)
- Some are in AIG_Nav_DW (NAV BI)
- One table (RPT_SOI) is used by 3 different IPE reports with different filters

**What I need**: The Athena database and table names for each source 
(see attached OFFICIAL_TABLE_MAPPING.md - just fill in the ??? columns)

**Why this matters**: This is the final piece I need to complete the C-PG-1 
automation, which will eliminate 40+ hours/month of manual Excel work.

**Timeline**: If I get these mappings this week, I can have a working 
prototype by next week.

Can we schedule a quick 15-minute call if anything is unclear? Happy to 
walk through the mapping together.

Thanks!

1. OFFICIAL_TABLE_MAPPING.md (primary - simple table to fill in)
2. ATHENA_QUESTIONS_FOR_TEAM.md (detailed questions)
3. DATA_SOURCE_MAPPING.md (visual context)

### Step 2: While Waiting (Optional Prep Work)

You can start preparing the implementation:

#### A. Design the aggregation function

```python
def calculate_cpg1_target_value(country: str, cutoff_date: str) -> dict:
    """
    Calculate C-PG-1 target value from 6 components
    
    Returns:
        {
            'total': float,
            'components': {
                'IPE_07': float,
                'IPE_10': float,
                'IPE_08': float,
                'IPE_31': float,
                'IPE_34': float,
                'IPE_12': float
            }
        }
    """
    pass  # TODO: Implement after getting table mappings
```

#### B. Design the reconciliation function

```python
def perform_cpg1_reconciliation(country: str, cutoff_date: str) -> dict:
    """
    Perform C-PG-1 reconciliation
    
    Returns:
        {
            'actuals': float,
            'target_values': float,
            'variance': float,
            'status': 'RECONCILED' | 'VARIANCE_DETECTED',
            'components': {...},
            'metadata': {...}
        }
    """
    pass  # TODO: Implement
```

#### C. Study Athena SQL syntax

Key differences from SQL Server to be aware of:
- Date literals: `DATE '2025-09-30'` instead of `'2025-09-30'`
- No square brackets: `posting_date` instead of `[Posting Date]`
- String functions: `CONCAT()` instead of `+`
- Date functions: `DATE_ADD()` instead of `DATEADD()`

---

### Step 3: Once You Get Responses

1. **Update `config_cpg1_athena.py`**
   - Replace all `???` with actual Athena table names
   - Add any missing columns
   - Update query templates with correct syntax

2. **Test each query individually**
   ```python
   # Test CR_04 first (simplest, most critical)
   import awswrangler as wr
   
   query = """
   SELECT COUNT(*) 
   FROM process_central_fin_dwh.actual_table_name
   LIMIT 5
   """
   
   df = wr.athena.read_sql_query(
       sql=query,
       database='process_central_fin_dwh'
   )
   
   print(df)
   ```

3. **Compare with manual Excel results**
   - Run your Athena query for a known period (e.g., June 2025)
   - Compare totals with the manual Excel files
   - Investigate any discrepancies

4. **Build the aggregation pipeline**
   - Once individual queries work, combine them
   - Implement the 6-component sum
   - Add reconciliation logic

5. **Generate evidence**
   - Run full reconciliation
   - Export to JSON
   - Validate format matches SOX requirements

## 🎓 Key Insights

### 1. The `RPT_SOI` Pattern
One table used 3 different ways is a common pattern in data warehouses. You'll need to understand which columns to filter on to distinguish:
- Prepayments (IPE_10)
- Unreconciled packages (IPE_12)
- Refunds (IPE_34)

**Question to ask**: "What column in `RPT_SOI` indicates the transaction type? Is it called `transaction_type`, `category`, or something else?"

### 2. The Multi-Table Join (IPE_31)
Four tables need to be joined. Common join patterns:
- All 4 tables share a `transaction_id` (simple)
- Primary-foreign key relationships (more complex)
- Time-based joins (least likely but possible)

**Question to ask**: "What are the join keys between the 4 `RPT_CASHREC*` tables? Can you provide a sample query?"

### 3. The FinRec Layer
Most tables are in the `AIG_Nav_Jumia_Reconciliation` database (FinRec). This is a reconciliation data warehouse layer that sits between raw operational systems and reporting.

**Implication**: The data is already pre-processed, which is GOOD. You don't need to replicate complex transformation logic - it's already done.

## 📊 Success Metrics (Unchanged)

| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **Time per reconciliation** | 5-8 hours | < 5 minutes |
| **Manual Excel files** | 8 files | 0 files |
| **Data operations** | 50+ manual steps | 0 manual steps |
| **Error risk** | High | None |
| **Evidence quality** | Partial | 100% complete |
| **Reproducibility** | Requires expert | Automated |

**ROI**: 40 hours/month × 12 months = 480 hours/year = 12 work-weeks saved
