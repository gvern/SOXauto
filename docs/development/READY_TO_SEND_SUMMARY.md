### Subject Line
```
C-PG-1 Automation: Athena Table Mapping Request (14 tables - 5 min of your time)
```

### Email Body

```
Hi Carlos/Joao,

Quick update: I've successfully connected to AWS Athena and completed my discovery 
of the C-PG-1 manual reconciliation process.

I've identified the exact 14 SQL Server tables used in C-PG-1 (based on official 
Common Report Reference docs + operational control documentation).

**What I need**: Just the Athena database and table names for these 14 sources.

See attached "QUICK_REFERENCE_FOR_TEAM.md" - it's a simple table you can fill in 
(should take ~5 minutes if you know where these tables are in Athena).

Key finding: IPE_31 (Collection Accounts) is more complex than initially 
documented - it uses 7 tables instead of 4. If there's a pre-joined view 
in Athena for this, that would simplify things significantly!

**Why this matters**: This is the last blocker for C-PG-1 automation, which will 
eliminate 50+ hours/month of manual Excel work.

**Timeline**: With these mappings, I can have a working prototype in 1-2 weeks.

Happy to jump on a quick call if easier to walk through together!

Thanks,
Gustave

## 🎓 What We Learned Today

### Discovery Process
1. **Start broad**: Excel files showed outputs
2. **Find official docs**: Common Report Reference gave exact sources
3. **Check operational reality**: Team's actual process revealed hidden complexity

### Key Insight: Documentation ≠ Reality
- Official docs said IPE_31 uses 4 tables
- Operational docs show it actually uses 7 tables
- Always check multiple sources!

### The Power of Specificity
- **Bad question**: "Where is the data?"
- **Good question**: "Where is the Athena equivalent of `RPT_CASHREC_TRANSACTION`?"
- **Best question**: "Here's a table with 14 SQL Server sources - can you fill in the Athena names?"

## 📊 Updated ROI Calculation

### Manual Process Effort (New Estimate)
- CR_04: 30 min (simple GL query)
- IPE_07: 1 hour (customer ledger extraction)
- IPE_10/12/34: 2 hours (RPT_SOI with 3 different filters)
- IPE_08: 45 min (voucher closing)
- **IPE_31: 3-4 hours** (7-table join in PowerPivot!)
- CR_05: 15 min (FX rates)
- Consolidation: 2 hours (combining all components)
- Reconciliation: 30 min (comparison and variance analysis)

**Total**: ~10-12 hours per reconciliation × 4-5 times/month = **50+ hours/month**

### Automated Process (Target)
- All queries: 3 minutes
- Aggregation: 1 minute
- Reconciliation: 30 seconds
- Evidence generation: 30 seconds

**Total**: < 5 minutes per reconciliation

### Value Delivered
- **Time saved**: 50 hours/month = 600 hours/year
- **FTE equivalent**: 0.3 FTE (30% of a person's time)
- **Error reduction**: Near 100% (no manual Excel operations)
- **Audit quality**: 100% evidence (vs partial manual screenshots)
