# Project Structure - Quick Reference

## 🎯 TL;DR

**Current State:** Flat structure with 20+ files in root directory ❌  
**Recommended State:** Organized structure with clear separation of concerns ✅

---

## 📊 Current Structure Issues

```
PG-01/
├── ❌ 8 Python modules (mixed purposes)
├── ❌ 7 Markdown docs (scattered)
├── ❌ 4 Config files (Docker, cloud)
├── ❌ Notes, diagrams, legacy files
└── ❌ No clear entry points
```

**Problems:**
- Hard to find things
- Can't scale to Phase 2 & 3
- No separation between production code and scripts
- Documentation scattered

---

## ✅ Recommended Structure

```
PG-01/
├── src/                    # All production code
│   ├── core/              # Phase 1: SOX automation
│   ├── bridges/           # Phase 2: Bridge analysis
│   ├── agents/            # Phase 3: AI agents
│   └── utils/             # Shared utilities
│
├── docs/                   # All documentation
│   ├── deployment/        # Deploy guides
│   ├── development/       # Business rules
│   ├── setup/             # Setup guides
│   └── architecture/      # Diagrams
│
├── tests/                  # All tests
├── scripts/                # Utility scripts
├── data/                   # Credentials & outputs (gitignored)
└── README.md              # Main entry point
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Crystal clear organization
- ✅ Scales naturally to 50+ IPEs
- ✅ Professional standards
- ✅ Easy onboarding

## 🚀 Two Options

### Option 1: Quick Wins (Recommended for Today) ⚡

**Time:** 5 minutes  
**Risk:** Zero  
**Benefit:** Cleaner project immediately

```bash
./quick_wins.sh
```

**What it does:**
- Moves docs to `docs/` folder
- Creates `data/` folder for credentials
- Updates `.gitignore`

**Perfect for:** Before tomorrow's meeting

---

### Option 2: Full Restructure (After POC Validation) 🏗️

**Time:** 30 minutes  
**Risk:** Low (requires import updates)  
**Benefit:** Production-ready structure

```bash
./restructure.sh
```

**What it does:**
- Full reorganization into `src/`, `tests/`, etc.
- Moves all files to logical locations
- Creates Python package structure

**Perfect for:** After Islam validates the POC

---

## 🎯 My Recommendation

### Today (Before Meeting)
```bash
./quick_wins.sh
git add .
git commit -m "docs: organize project structure"
```

**Result:** Clean, professional appearance with minimal risk

### After Meeting (If POC Validated)
```bash
./restructure.sh
# Update imports
# Test everything
git commit -m "refactor: restructure for scalability"
```

**Result:** Production-ready codebase ready for Phase 2 & 3

## 📋 Migration Checklist

### Quick Wins ✅
- [ ] Run `./quick_wins.sh`
- [ ] Move `credentials.json` to `data/credentials/`
- [ ] Update `CREDENTIALS_FILE` path in scripts
- [ ] Commit changes

### Full Restructure (Later) ✅
- [ ] Run `./restructure.sh`
- [ ] Update imports in all Python files
- [ ] Update `Dockerfile` COPY commands
- [ ] Test `src/core/main.py` works
- [ ] Test `src/bridges/timing_difference.py` works
- [ ] Update README.md
- [ ] Commit changes

## 🔍 Key Files After Restructure

| Old Location | New Location | Purpose |
|--------------|--------------|---------|
| `main.py` | `src/core/main.py` | SOX orchestrator |
| `timing_difference_analysis.py` | `src/bridges/timing_difference.py` | Bridge analysis (entry point: `python3 -m src.bridges.timing_difference`; input Excel files are expected in `Bridge_source/`)
| `gcp_utils.py` | `src/utils/gcp_utils.py` | Cloud utilities |
| `deploy.md` | `docs/deployment/deploy.md` | Deploy guide |
| `classification_matrix.md` | `docs/development/classification_matrix.md` | Business rules |

---

## 💡 Why This Matters

### Without Structure
```python
# Confusing imports
from ipe_runner import IPERunner
from timing_difference_analysis import analyze
# Which is production? Which is a script?
```

### With Structure
```python
# Clear purpose
from src.core.ipe_runner import IPERunner      # Production
from src.bridges.timing_difference import analyze  # Bridge script
# Obvious what's what!
```

---

## 🎯 Bottom Line

**Do `quick_wins.sh` today** → Clean project for tomorrow's meeting  
**Do `restructure.sh` after POC** → Production-ready for Phase 2

Both scripts are tested and safe. You can always revert if needed.
